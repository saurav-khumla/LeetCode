Table: Accounts

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| account_id  | int  |
| income      | int  |
+-------------+------+
account_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row contains information about the monthly income for one bank account.
 

Write a solution to calculate the number of bank accounts for each salary category. The salary categories are:

"Low Salary": All the salaries strictly less than $20000.
"Average Salary": All the salaries in the inclusive range [$20000, $50000].
"High Salary": All the salaries strictly greater than $50000.
The result table must contain all three categories. If there are no accounts in a category, return 0.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Accounts table:
+------------+--------+
| account_id | income |
+------------+--------+
| 3          | 108939 |
| 2          | 12747  |
| 8          | 87709  |
| 6          | 91796  |
+------------+--------+
Output: 
+----------------+----------------+
| category       | accounts_count |
+----------------+----------------+
| Low Salary     | 1              |
| Average Salary | 0              |
| High Salary    | 3              |
+----------------+----------------+4



solution :

SELECT 
    b.category
    ,COUNT(account_id)  accounts_count
FROM Accounts a
RIGHT OUTER JOIN (VALUES('Low Salary'),('High Salary'),('Average Salary')) AS b(category) 
    ON CASE WHEN income < 20000 THEN 'Low Salary'
        WHEN income > 50000 THEN 'High Salary'
        ELSE 'Average Salary' END = b.category
GROUP BY b.category

or 

/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
select 'High Salary' as category, (select count(*) from Accounts where income > 50000) as accounts_count
union all
select 'Average Salary' as category, (select count(*) from Accounts where income >= 20000 and income <= 50000) as accounts_count
union all
select 'Low Salary' as category, (select count(*) from Accounts where income < 20000) as accounts_count

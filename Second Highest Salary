Table: Employee

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.
 

Write a solution to find the second highest distinct salary from the Employee table. If there is no second highest salary, return null (return None in Pandas).

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
Output: 
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
Example 2:

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
+----+--------+
Output: 
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| null                |
+---------------------+

SOLUTIONS:- 

/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
SELECT CASE
           WHEN count(DISTINCT a.SALARY)<1 THEN NULL
           ELSE MAX(a.SALARY) 
           END AS SecondHighestSalary 
  FROM (SELECT DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY SALARY DESC) AS RN, SALARY
          FROM EMPLOYEE
        ) a
 WHERE RN=2
